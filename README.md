# Assignment I

Instructions: This code is from the java.util.Collections binary search method. Identify the error, write a JUnit test to expose the error, and correct the code so that the test passes. You may need to experiment with heap size parameters in order to get your test code to run, and you may not be able to get your test code to run correctly. You will need to discuss these issues in the discussion forum for this week.  Everyone will receive credit for the rubric submission requirement to deliver an executable jar file WITHOUT it actually executing for this assignment. Please be sure to include your source code with the submission. It may be included in the jar file, or as a separate .zip file.
